Resize windows interactively.
INCREMENT is the number of lines by which borders should move.

By default, the method for resizing is by moving the borders.
The left/right key will move the only movable vertical border to
the left/right and the up/down key will move the only horizontal
movable border up/down.  If there are two movable borders, the
right and the bottom border will have priority over the left and
upper border.  You can reverse this priority by using \\[windresize-left-force-left],
\\[windresize-right-force-left], etc.

Resizing can also be done by increasing/decreasing the window
width and height.  The up and down arrow keys will enlarge or
shrink the window vertically and the right and left arrow keys
will enlarge or shrink the window horizontally.

You can toggle the method with \\[windresize-toggle-method].

You can set the number of line by which a border should move by
calling \\[windresize-set-increment] with a numeric prefix.
You can temporarily negate the number of lines by which the
windows are resized by using \\[windresize-left-minus], \\[windresize-right-minus], etc.
If you want to permanently negate this increment value,
use `\\[windresize-negate-increment]' instead.

You can also save window configurations with `\\[windresize-save-window-configuration]' in a ring,
and restore them with `\\[windresize-restore-window-configuration]'.

`\\[windresize-cancel-and-quit]' will quit `windresize' and cancel any change.  `\\[windresize-exit]'

Create a Hydra - a family of functions with prefix NAME.

NAME should be a symbol, it will be the prefix of all functions
defined here.

BODY has the format:

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

(autoload 'posframe-workable-p "posframe" "\
Test posframe workable status.")
(autoload 'posframe-show "posframe" "\
Pop up a posframe to show STRING at POSITION.

 (1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx
   :parent-frame xxx
   :parent-window-start xxx
   :parent-window-end xxx
   :parent-window-left xxx
   :parent-window-top xxx
   :parent-frame-width xxx
   :parent-frame-height xxx
   :parent-window xxx
   :parent-window-width  xxx
   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx
   :parent-text-scale-mode-amount xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-or-right-other-corner'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
10. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
19. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
20. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) CURSOR, TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR and WINDOW-POINT

By default, cursor is not showed in posframe, user can let cursor
showed with this argument help by set its value to a `cursor-type'.

TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR will let redisplay put the terminal
cursor in a non-selected frame, which is useful when use
vertico-posframe like package in tty.

When cursor need to be showed in posframe, user may need to set
WINDOW-POINT to the point of BUFFER, which can let cursor showed
at this point.

 (11) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (12) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (13) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (14) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (15) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (17) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (18) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (19) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other application
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

Minor mode that allows you to peek at buffers before deciding to open them.

While the mode is active treemacs will automatically display the file at point,
without leaving the treemacs window.

Peeking will stop when you leave the treemacs window, be it through a command
like `treemacs-RET-action' or some other window selection change.

Files' buffers that have been opened for peeking will be cleaned up if they did
not exist before peeking started.

The peeked window can be scrolled using
`treemacs-next/previous-line-other-window' and
`treemacs-next/previous-page-other-window'

`Treemacs-Peek mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable
the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

This is a minor mode meant for those who do not care about treemacs' workspace
features, or its preference to work with multiple projects simultaneously.  When
enabled it will function as an automated version of
`treemacs-display-current-project-exclusively', making sure that, after a small
idle delay, the current project, and *only* the current project, is displayed in
treemacs.

The project detection is based on the current buffer, and will try to determine
the project using the following methods, in the order they are listed:

- the current projectile.el project, if `treemacs-projectile' is installed
- the current project.el project
- the current `default-directory'

The update will only happen when treemacs is in the foreground, meaning a
treemacs window must exist in the current scope.

This mode requires at least Emacs version 27 since it relies on
`window-buffer-change-functions' and `window-selection-change-functions'.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Treemacs-Project-Follow mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is
positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the

This acts as more fine-grained alternative to `treemacs-follow-mode' and will
thus disable `treemacs-follow-mode' on activation.  When enabled treemacs will
focus not only the file of the current buffer, but also the tag at point.

The follow action is attached to Emacs' idle timer and will run
`treemacs-tag-follow-delay' seconds of idle time.  The delay value is not an
integer, meaning it accepts floating point values like 1.5.

Every time a tag is followed a re--scan of the imenu index is forced by
temporarily setting `imenu-auto-rescan' to t (though a cache is applied as long
as the buffer is unmodified).  This is necessary to assure that creation or
deletion of tags does not lead to errors and guarantees an always up-to-date tag
view.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window
needs to be temporarily selected, which will reset blink-cursor-mode's timer if
it is enabled.  This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appearance of the tag follow action lasting much
longer than it really does.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Treemacs-Tag-Follow mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

At first glance, this method may seem convenient, but in reality, it was created solely for testing purposes during development. Its role is to verify that all transformation patterns are properly traversed, and it was never intended for regular use. In fact, the developers themselves do not use it at all and strongly discourage its use.

Using this method in practice leads to unnecessary stress, as it forces traversal through every possible transformation pattern, making the conversion process excessively long. Moreover, under the current default settings, the method may not even complete a full cycle depending on the mode in use.

For example, in modes where hyphens are not considered part of variable names, a string like `foo-bar' will be split into `foo' and `bar', and the transformation will only proceed on `bar'. This means the intended conversion process can be interrupted midway depending on the context.

For these reasons, this method should not be used as part of your regular workflow. It is strictly meant for internal verification during development, and we advise against using it in day-to-day usage." t)

==================== ========================================================


* Callback functions

Callback functions STATUS, ERROR, COMPLETE and `cdr\\='s in element of
the alist STATUS-CODE take same keyword arguments listed below.  For
forward compatibility, these functions must ignore unused keyword
arguments (i.e., it\\='s better to use `&allow-other-keys\\=' [#]_).::

    (CALLBACK                      ; SUCCESS/ERROR/COMPLETE/STATUS-CODE
     :data          data           ; whatever PARSER function returns, or nil
     :error-thrown  error-thrown   ; (ERROR-SYMBOL . DATA), or nil
     :symbol-status symbol-status  ; success/error/timeout/abort/parse-error
     :response      response       ; request-response object
     ...)

.. [#] `&allow-other-keys\\=' is a special \"markers\" available in macros
   in the CL library for function definition such as `cl-defun\\=' and
   `cl-function\\='.  Without this marker, you need to specify all arguments
   to be passed.  This becomes problem when request.el adds new arguments
   when calling callback functions.  If you use `&allow-other-keys\\='
   (or manually ignore other arguments), your code is free from this
   problem.  See info node `(cl) Argument Lists\\=' for more information.

Arguments data, error-thrown, symbol-status can be accessed by
`request-response-data\\=', `request-response-error-thrown\\=',
`request-response-symbol-status\\=' accessors, i.e.::

    (request-response-data RESPONSE)  ; same as data

Response object holds other information which can be accessed by
the following accessors:
`request-response-status-code\\=',
`request-response-url\\=' and
`request-response-settings\\='

* STATUS-CODE callback

STATUS-CODE is an alist of the following format::

    ((N-1 . CALLBACK-1)
     (N-2 . CALLBACK-2)
     ...)

Here, N-1, N-2,... are integer status codes such as 200.


* FILES

FILES is an alist of the following format::

    ((NAME-1 . FILE-1)
     (NAME-2 . FILE-2)
     ...)

where FILE-N is a list of the form::

    (FILENAME &key PATH BUFFER STRING MIME-TYPE)

FILE-N can also be a string (path to the file) or a buffer object.
In that case, FILENAME is set to the file name or buffer name.

Example FILES argument::

    `((\"passwd\"   . \"/etc/passwd\")                ; filename = passwd
      (\"scratch\"  . ,(get-buffer \"*scratch*\"))    ; filename = *scratch*
      (\"passwd2\"  . (\"password.txt\" :file \"/etc/passwd\"))
      (\"scratch2\" . (\"scratch.txt\"  :buffer ,(get-buffer \"*scratch*\")))
      (\"data\"     . (\"data.csv\"     :data \"1,2,3\\n4,5,6\\n\")))

.. note:: FILES is implemented only for curl backend for now.
   As furl.el_ supports multipart POST, it should be possible to
   support FILES in pure elisp by making furl.el_ another backend.
   Contributions are welcome.

   .. _furl.el: https://code.google.com/p/furl-el/


* PARSER function

PARSER function takes no argument and it is executed in the
buffer with HTTP response body.  The current position in the HTTP
response buffer is at the beginning of the buffer.  As the HTTP
header is stripped off, the cursor is actually at the beginning
of the response body.  So, for example, you can pass `json-read\\='
to parse JSON object in the buffer.  To fetch whole response as a
string, pass `buffer-string\\='.

When using `json-read\\=', it is useful to know that the returned
type can be modified by `json-object-type\\=', `json-array-type\\=',
`json-key-type\\=', `json-false\\=' and `json-null\\='.  See docstring of
each function for what it does.  For example, to convert JSON
objects to plist instead of alist, wrap `json-read\\=' by `lambda\\='
like this.::

    (request
     \"https://...\"
     :parser (lambda ()
               (let ((json-object-type \\='plist))
                 (json-read)))
     ...)

This is analogous to the `dataType\\=' argument of jQuery.ajax_.
Only this function can access to the process buffer, which
is killed immediately after the execution of this function.

* SYNC

Synchronous request is functional, but *please* don\\='t use it
other than testing or debugging.  Emacs users have better things
to do rather than waiting for HTTP request.  If you want a better
way to write callback chains, use `request-deferred\\='.

If you can\\='t avoid using it (e.g., you are inside of some hook
which must return some value), make sure to set TIMEOUT to
relatively small value.

Due to limitation of `url-retrieve-synchronously\\=', response slots
`request-response-error-thrown\\=', `request-response-history\\=' and
`request-response-url\\=' are unknown (always nil) when using
synchronous request with `url-retrieve\\=' backend.

* Note

API of `request\\=' is somewhat mixture of jQuery.ajax_ (Javascript)
and requests.request_ (Python).

  e.g. a literal string, or the name of a variable which holds
  the program path.

ARGS

  Command-line arguments for the program.  If provided, this is a
  form which evaluates to a list of strings at runtime.  Default
  is the empty list.  This form is evaluated at runtime so that
  you can use buffer-local variables to influence the args passed
  to the reformatter program: the variable `input-file' will be
  lexically bound to the path of a file containing the text to be
  reformatted: see the keyword options INPUT-FILE, STDIN and
  STDOUT for more information.

STDIN

  When non-nil (the default), the program is passed the input
  data on stdin.  Set this to nil when your reformatter can only
  operate on files in place.  In such a case, your ARGS should
  include a reference to the `input-file' variable, which will be
  bound to an input path when evaluated.

STDOUT

  When non-nil (the default), the program is expected to write
  the reformatted text to stdout.  Set this to nil if your
  reformatter can only operate on files in place, in which case
  the contents of the temporary input file will be used as the
  replacement text.

INPUT-FILE

  Sometimes your reformatter program might expect files to be in
  a certain directory or have a certain file extension.  This option
  lets you handle that.

  If provided, it is a form which will be evaluated before each
  run of the formatter, and is expected to return a temporary
  file path suitable for holding the region to be reformatted.
  It must not produce the same path as the current buffer's file
  if that is set: you shouldn't be operating directly on the
  buffer's backing file.  The temporary input file will be
  deleted automatically.  You might find the functions
  `reformatter-temp-file-in-current-directory' and
  `reformatter-temp-file' helpful.

MODE

  Unless nil, also generate a minor mode that will call the
  reformatter command from `before-save-hook' when enabled.
  Default is t.

GROUP

  If provided, this is the custom group used for any generated
  modes or custom variables.  Don't forget to declare this group
  using a `defgroup' form.

LIGHTER

  If provided, this is a mode lighter string which will be used
  for the \"-on-save\" minor mode.  It should have a leading
  space.  The supplied value will be used as the default for a
  generated custom variable which specifies the mode lighter.
  Default is nil, ie. no lighter.

KEYMAP

  If provided, this is the symbol name of the \"-on-save\" mode's
  keymap, which you must declare yourself.  Default is no keymap.

EXIT-CODE-SUCCESS-P

  If provided, this is a function object callable with `funcall'
  which accepts an integer process exit code, and returns non-nil
  if that exit code is considered successful.  This could be a
  lambda, quoted symbol or sharp-quoted symbol.  If not supplied,
  the code is considered successful if it is `zerop'.

WORKING-DIRECTORY

  Directory where your reformatter program is started. If provided, this
  should be a form that evaluates to a string at runtime. Default is the
  value of `default-directory' in the buffer.

INTERACTIVE-MODES

  If provided, this is a list of mode names (as unquoted
  symbols).  The created commands for formatting regions and
  buffers are then tagged for interactive use in these modes,
  making them compatible with some built-in predicate functions
  for `read-extended-command-predicate', like
  `command-completion-default-include-p'.

Execute START-FUNC (often a lambda) in a subordinate Emacs process.
When done, the return value is passed to FINISH-FUNC.  Example:

    (async-start
       ;; What to do in the child process
       (lambda ()
         (message \"This is a test\")
         (sleep-for 3)
         222)

       ;; What to do when it finishes
       (lambda (result)
         (message \"Async process done, result should be 222: %s\"
                  result)))

If you call `async-send' from a child process, the message will
be also passed to the FINISH-FUNC.  You can test RESULT to see if
it is a message by using `async-message-p'.  If nil, it means
this is the final result.  Example of the FINISH-FUNC:

    (lambda (result)
      (if (async-message-p result)
          (message \"Received a message from child process: %s\" result)
        (message \"Async process done, result: %s\" result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()
                     (message \"This is a test\")
                     (sleep-for 3)
                     222))))

        (message \"I'm going to do some work here\") ;; ....

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     \\='ignore)

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to
`async-ready' or `async-wait'.

(autoload 'llama "llama" "\
Expand to a `lambda' expression that wraps around FN and BODY.

This macro provides a compact way to write short `lambda' expressions.
It expands to a `lambda' expression, which calls the function FN with
arguments BODY and returns its value.  The arguments of the `lambda'
expression are derived from symbols found in BODY.

Each symbol from `%1' through `%9', which appears in an unquoted part
of BODY, specifies a mandatory argument.  Each symbol from `&1' through
`&9', which appears in an unquoted part of BODY, specifies an optional
argument.  The symbol `&*' specifies extra (`&rest') arguments.

The shorter symbol `%' can be used instead of `%1', but using both in
the same expression is not allowed.  Likewise `&' can be used instead
of `&1'.  These shorthands are not recognized in function position.

To support binding forms that use a vector as VARLIST (such as `-let'
from the `dash' package), argument symbols are also detected inside of
vectors.

The space between `##' and FN can be omitted because `##' is read-syntax
for the symbol whose name is the empty string.  If you prefer you can
place a space there anyway, and if you prefer to not use this somewhat
magical symbol at all, you can instead use the alternative name `llama'.

Instead of:

  (lambda (a &optional _ c &rest d)
    (foo a (bar c) d))

you can use this macro and write:

  (##foo %1 (bar &3) &*)

which expands to:

  (lambda (%1 &optional _&2 &3 &rest &*)
    (foo %1 (bar &3) &*))

Unused trailing arguments and mandatory unused arguments at the border
between mandatory and optional arguments are also supported:

  (##list %1 _%3 &5 _&6)

becomes:

  (lambda (%1 _%2 _%3 &optional _&4 &5 _&6)
    (list %1 &5))

Note how `_%3' and `_&6' are removed from the body, because their names
begin with an underscore.  Also note that `_&4' is optional, unlike the
explicitly specified `_%3'.

Which set of key bindings to add to the global keymap, if any.

This option controls which set of Magit key bindings, if any, may
be added to the global keymap, even before Magit is first used in
the current Emacs session.

If the value is nil, no bindings are added.

If \\+`default', maybe add:

    \\`C-x' \\`g'     `magit-status'
    \\`C-x' \\`M-g'   `magit-dispatch'
    \\`C-c' \\`M-g'   `magit-file-dispatch'

    \\`C-c' \\`g'     `magit-dispatch'
    \\`C-c' \\`f'     `magit-file-dispatch'

    These bindings are strongly recommended, but we cannot use
    them by default, because the \\`C-c <LETTER>' namespace is
    strictly reserved for bindings added by the user.

The bindings in the chosen set may be added when
`after-init-hook' is run.  Each binding is added if, and only
if, at that time no other key is bound to the same command,
and no other command is bound to the same key.  In other words
we try to avoid adding bindings that are unnecessary, as well
as bindings that conflict with other bindings.

Adding these bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook' is
run to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their init
file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit' is
loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that all
the potentially conflicting user bindings have already been
added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately, when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

  repository.  After creating the repository show its status
  buffer.

These fallback behaviors can also be forced using one or more
prefix arguments:

* With two prefix arguments (or more precisely a numeric prefix
  value of 16 or greater) read an arbitrary directory and act on
  it as described above.  The same could be accomplished using
  the command `magit-init'.

* With a single prefix argument read an existing repository, or
  if none can be found based on `magit-repository-directories',
  then fall back to the same behavior as with two prefix
  arguments.

Read a string in the minibuffer, with completion.

PROMPT is a string, normally ending in a colon and a space.
`ivy-count-format' is prepended to PROMPT during completion.

COLLECTION is either a list of strings, a function, an alist, or
a hash table, supplied for `minibuffer-completion-table'.

PREDICATE is applied to filter out the COLLECTION immediately.
This argument is for compatibility with `completing-read'.

When REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil, only members of COLLECTION can be
selected. In can also be a lambda.

If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, then insert that input in the
minibuffer initially.

HISTORY is a name of a variable to hold the completion session
history.

KEYMAP is composed with `ivy-minibuffer-map'.

PRESELECT, when non-nil, determines which one of the candidates
matching INITIAL-INPUT to select initially.  An integer stands
for the position of the desired candidate in the collection,
counting from zero.  Otherwise, use the first occurrence of
PRESELECT in the collection.  Comparison is first done with
`equal'.  If that fails, and when applicable, match PRESELECT as
a regular expression.

DEF is for compatibility with `completing-read'.

UPDATE-FN is called each time the candidate list is re-displayed.

When SORT is non-nil, `ivy-sort-functions-alist' determines how
to sort candidates before displaying them.

ACTION is a function to call after selecting a candidate.
It takes one argument, the selected candidate. If COLLECTION is
an alist, the argument is a cons cell, otherwise it's a string.

MULTI-ACTION, when non-nil, is called instead of ACTION when
there are marked candidates. It takes the list of candidates as
its only argument. When it's nil, ACTION is called on each marked
candidate.

UNWIND is a function of no arguments to call before exiting.

RE-BUILDER is a function transforming input text into a regex
pattern.

MATCHER is a function which can override how candidates are
filtered based on user input.  It takes a regex pattern and a
list of candidates, and returns the list of matching candidates.

DYNAMIC-COLLECTION is a boolean specifying whether the list of
candidates is updated after each input by calling COLLECTION.

EXTRA-PROPS is a plist that can be used to store
collection-specific session-specific data.

CALLER is a symbol to uniquely identify the caller to `ivy-read'.
It is used, along with COLLECTION, to determine which
customizations apply to the current completion session.

Toggle Iedit mode.
This command behaves differently, depending on the mark, point,
prefix argument and variable `iedit-transient-mark-sensitive'.

If Iedit mode is off, turn Iedit mode on.

When Iedit mode is turned on, all the occurrences of the current
region in the buffer (possibly narrowed) or a region are
highlighted.  If one occurrence is modified, the change are
propagated to all other occurrences simultaneously.

If region is not active, `iedit-default-occurrence' is called to
get an occurrence candidate, according to the thing at point.  It
might be url, email address, markup tag or current symbol(or
word).

In the above two situations, with digit prefix argument 0, only
occurrences in current function are matched.  This is good for
renaming refactoring in programming.

You can also switch to Iedit mode from isearch mode directly.  The
current search string is used as occurrence.  All occurrences of
the current search string are highlighted.

With an universal prefix argument ARG, the occurrence when Iedit mode
is turned off last time in current buffer is used as occurrence.
This is intended to recover last Iedit mode which is turned off.
If region active, Iedit mode is limited within the current
region.

With repeated universal prefix argument, the occurrence when
Iedit mode is turned off last time (might be in other buffer) is
used as occurrence.  If region active, Iedit mode is limited
within the current region.

With digital prefix argument 1, Iedit mode is limited on the
current symbol or the active region, which means just one
instance is highlighted.  This behavior serves as a start point
of incremental selection work flow.

If Iedit mode is on and region is active, Iedit mode is
restricted in the region, e.g. the occurrences outside of the
region is excluded.

If Iedit mode is on and region is active, with an universal
prefix argument, Iedit mode is restricted outside of the region,
e.g. the occurrences in the region is excluded.

Major mode for editing Go source text.

This mode provides (not just) basic editing capabilities for
working with Go code. It offers almost complete syntax
highlighting, indentation that is almost identical to gofmt and
proper parsing of the buffer content to allow features such as
navigation by function, manipulation of comments or detection of
strings.

In addition to these core features, it offers various features to
help with writing Go code. You can directly run buffer content
through gofmt, read godoc documentation from within Emacs, modify
and clean up the list of package imports or interact with the
Playground (uploading and downloading pastes).

The following extra functions are defined:

- `gofmt'
- `godoc' and `godoc-at-point'
- `go-import-add'
- `go-goto-arguments'
- `go-goto-docstring'
- `go-goto-function'
- `go-goto-function-name'
- `go-goto-imports'
- `go-goto-return-values'
- `go-goto-method-receiver'
- `go-play-buffer' and `go-play-region'
- `go-download-play'
- `godef-describe' and `godef-jump'
- `go-coverage'

If you want to automatically run `gofmt' before saving a file,
add the following hook to your Emacs configuration:

(add-hook 'before-save-hook #'gofmt-before-save)

If you want to use `godef-jump' instead of etags (or similar),
consider binding godef-jump to `M-.', which is the default key
for `find-tag':

(add-hook 'go-mode-hook (lambda ()
                          (local-set-key (kbd \"M-.\") #'godef-jump)))

Please note that godef is an external dependency. You can install
it with

go get github.com/rogpeppe/godef


If you're looking for even more integration with Go, namely
on-the-fly syntax checking, auto-completion and snippets, it is
recommended that you look at flycheck
(see URL `https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck') or flymake in combination

(autoload 'general-define-key "general" "\
The primary key definition function provided by general.el.

Define MAPS, optionally using DEFINER, in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES
and KEYMAPS.

MAPS consists of paired keys (vectors or strings; also see
`general-implicit-kbd') and definitions (those mentioned in `define-key''s
docstring and general.el's \"extended\" definitions). All pairs (when not
ignored) will be recorded and can be later displayed with
`general-describe-keybindings'.

If DEFINER is specified, a custom key definer will be used to bind MAPS. See
general.el's documentation/README for more information.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this allows using the keymap name for other purposes, e.g. deferring
keybindings if the keymap symbol is not bound, optionally inferring the
corresponding major mode for a symbol by removing \"-map\" for :which-key,
easily storing the keymap name for use with `general-describe-keybindings',
etc.). Note that general.el provides other key definer macros that do not
require quoting keymaps.

STATES corresponds to the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users
should not set STATES. When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key*' will be
used (the evil auxiliary keymaps corresponding STATES and KEYMAPS will be used);
otherwise `define-key' will be used (unless DEFINER is specified). KEYMAPS
defaults to 'global. There is also 'local, which create buffer-local
keybindings for both evil and non-evil keybindings. There are other special,
user-alterable \"shorthand\" symbols for keymaps and states (see
`general-keymap-aliases' and `general-state-aliases').

Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be lists or single symbols. If any
keymap does not exist, those keybindings will be deferred until the keymap does
exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this function.

PREFIX corresponds to a key to prefix keys in MAPS with and defaults to none. To
bind/unbind a key specified with PREFIX, \"\" can be specified as a key in
MAPS (e.g. ...:prefix \"SPC\" \"\" nil... will unbind space).

The keywords in this paragraph are only useful for evil users. If
NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used instead of PREFIX for
states in `general-non-normal-states' (e.g. the emacs and insert states). This
argument will only have an effect if one of these states is in STATES or if
corresponding global keymap (e.g. `evil-insert-state-map') is in KEYMAPS.
Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to
bind keys in all states under the specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX,
GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX from applying to `general-non-normal-states'.
INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper function/macro so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify
all of them. If none of the other prefix keyword arguments are specified, INFIX
will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP is specified, a prefix command and/or keymap
will be created. PREFIX-NAME can be additionally specified to set the keymap
menu name/prompt. If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, `define-prefix-command' will
be used. Otherwise, only a prefix keymap will be created. Previously created
prefix commands/keymaps will never be redefined/cleared. All prefixes (including
the INFIX key, if specified) will then be bound to PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP.
If the user did not specify any PREFIX or manually specify any KEYMAPS, general
will bind all MAPS in the prefix keymap corresponding to either PREFIX-MAP or
PREFIX-COMMAND instead of in the default keymap.

PREDICATE corresponds to a predicate to check to determine whether a definition
should be active (e.g. \":predicate '(eobp)\"). Definitions created with a
predicate will only be active when the predicate is true. When the predicate is
false, key lookup will continue to search for a match in lower-precedence
keymaps.

In addition to the normal definitions supported by `define-key', general.el also
provides \"extended\" definitions, which are plists containing the normal
definition as well as other keywords. For example, PREDICATE can be specified
globally or locally in an extended definition. New global (~general-define-key~)
and local (extended definition) keywords can be added by the user. See
`general-extended-def-keywords' and general.el's documentation/README for more
information.

PACKAGE is the global version of the extended definition keyword that specifies
the package a keymap is defined in (used for \"autoloading\" keymaps)

PROPERTIES, REPEAT, and JUMP are the global versions of the extended definition
keywords used for adding evil command properties to commands.

MAJOR-MODES, WK-MATCH-KEYS, WK-MATCH-BINDINGS, and WK-FULL-KEYS are the
corresponding global versions of which-key extended definition keywords. They
will only have an effect for extended definitions that specify :which-key or
:wk. See the section on extended definitions in the general.el
documentation/README for more information.

LISPY-PLIST and WORF-PLIST are the global versions of extended definition
keywords that are used for each corresponding custom DEFINER.

Create and return a command that simulates KEYS in STATE and KEYMAP.

`general-key' should be prefered over this whenever possible as it is simpler
and has saner functionality in many cases because it does not rely on
`unread-command-events' (e.g. \"C-h k\" will show the docstring of the command
to be simulated ; see the readme for more information). The main downsides of
`general-key' are that it cannot simulate a command followed by keys or
subsequent commands, and which-key does not currently work well with it when
simulating a prefix key/incomplete key sequence.

KEYS should be a string given in `kbd' notation. It can also be a list of a
single command followed by a string of the key(s) to simulate after calling that
command. STATE should only be specified by evil users and should be a quoted
evil state. KEYMAP should not be quoted. Both STATE and KEYMAP aliases are
supported (but they have to be set when the macro is expanded). When neither
STATE or KEYMAP are specified, the key(s) will be simulated in the current
context.

If NAME is specified, it will replace the automatically generated function name.
NAME should not be quoted. If DOCSTRING is specified, it will replace the
automatically generated docstring.

Normally the generated function will look up KEY in the correct context to try
to match a command. To prevent this lookup, LOOKUP can be specified as nil.
Generally, you will want to keep LOOKUP non-nil because this will allow checking
the evil repeat property of matched commands to determine whether or not they
should be recorded. See the docstring for `general--simulate-keys' for more
information about LOOKUP.

When a WHICH-KEY description is specified, it will replace the command name in
the which-key popup.

When a command name is specified and that command has been remapped (i.e. [remap
command] is currently bound), the remapped version will be used instead of the
original command unless REMAP is specified as nil (it is true by default).

The advantages of this over a keyboard macro are as follows:
- Prefix arguments are supported
- The user can control the context in which the keys are simulated
- The user can simulate both a named command and keys
- The user can simulate an incomplete key sequence (e.g. for a keymap)

Create and return a command that runs FALLBACK-COMMAND or a command in MAPS.
MAPS consists of <key> <command> pairs. If a key in MAPS is matched, the
corresponding command will be run. Otherwise FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run with
the unmatched keys. So, for example, if \"ab\" was pressed, and \"ab\" is not
one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function. By
default, `cl-gensym' is used to prevent name clashes (e.g. allows the user to
create multiple different commands using `self-insert-command' as the
FALLBACK-COMMAND without explicitly specifying NAME to manually prevent
clashes).

Flycheck is a minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.

In `flycheck-mode' the buffer is automatically syntax-checked
using the first suitable syntax checker from `flycheck-checkers'.
Use `flycheck-select-checker' to select a checker for the current
buffer manually.

If you run into issues, use `\\[flycheck-verify-setup]' to get help.

Flycheck supports many languages out of the box, and many
additional ones are available on MELPA.  Adding new ones is very
easy.  Complete documentation is available online at URL
`https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/'.  Please report issues and
request features at URL `https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck'.

Flycheck displays its status in the mode line.  In the default
configuration, it looks like this:

`FlyC'     This buffer has not been checked yet.
`FlyC*'    Flycheck is running.  Expect results soon!
`FlyC:0'   Last check resulted in no errors and no warnings.
`FlyC:3|5' This buffer contains three errors and five warnings.
           Use `\\[flycheck-list-errors]' to see the list.
`FlyC-'    Flycheck doesn't have a checker for this buffer.

You may also see the following icons:
`FlyC!'    The checker crashed.
`FlyC.'    The last syntax check was manually interrupted.
`FlyC?'    The checker did something unexpected, like exiting with 1
           but returning no errors.

The following keybindings are available in `flycheck-mode':

\\{flycheck-mode-map}
(you can change the prefix by customizing
`flycheck-keymap-prefix')

If called interactively, enable Flycheck mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it if ARG is zero or negative.  If called from Lisp,
also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if
ARG is ‘toggle’; disable the mode otherwise.

(fn &optional ARG)" t)
(autoload 'flycheck-define-error-level "flycheck" "\
Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0; info is -10, warning is 10, and
     error is 100.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAPS'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level, or a cons of two bitmaps (one for
     narrow fringes and one for wide fringes).  See Info node
     `(elisp)Fringe Bitmaps' for more information about fringe
     bitmaps, including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:margin-spec SPEC'
     A display specification indicating what to display in the
     margin when `flycheck-indication-mode' is `left-margin' or
     `right-margin'.  See Info node `(elisp)Displaying in the
     Margins'.  If omitted, Flycheck generates an image spec from
     the fringe bitmap.

`:error-list-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.

(fn LEVEL &rest PROPERTIES)")
(function-put 'flycheck-define-error-level 'lisp-indent-function 1)
(autoload 'flycheck-define-command-checker "flycheck" "\
Define SYMBOL as syntax checker to run a command.

Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', which uses an external command
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for
`flycheck-define-generic-checker'.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Some checkers that support reading from standard input have
     a separate flag to indicate the name of the file whose
     contents are being passed on standard input (typically
     `stdin-filename').  In that case, use the `(option)' form in
     `:command' to pass the value of variable `buffer-file-name'
     when the current buffer has a file name (that is,
     use `option \"--stdin-file-name\" buffer-file-name').

     For buffers not backed by files, checkers that support input
     on stdin typically report a file name like `-' or `<stdin>'.
     Make sure your error parser or patterns expect these file
     names (for example, use `(or \"<stdin>\" (file-name))') or
     call `flycheck-remove-error-file-names' in a custom
     `:error-filter'.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.

Search with `grep' for files in DIR where the content matches a regexp.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be nil, a
directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If `consult-grep'
is called interactively with a prefix argument, the user can specify the
directories or files to search in.  Multiple directories or files must
be separated by comma in the minibuffer, since they are read via
`completing-read-multiple'.  By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.  Otherwise
the `default-directory' is searched.  If the command is invoked with a
double prefix argument (twice `C-u') the user is asked for a project, if
not yet inside a project, or the current project is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep input) is
passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second part of the
string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as
the first character of the input string.  The format is similar to
Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.  Furthermore command
line options can be passed to grep, specified behind --.  The overall
prompt input has the form `#async-input --grep-opt#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs regular
expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs
search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions.
Furthermore the asynchronous input split into words, each word must
match separately and in any order.  See `consult--regexp-compiler' for
the inner workings.  In order to disable transformations of the grep
input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -C3           : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.

Toggle contextual code coloring.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Context Coloring mode if ARG

enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

Context Coloring mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When
enabled, code is colored by scope.  Scopes are colored
hierarchically.  Variables referenced from nested scopes retain
the color of their defining scopes.  Certain syntax, like
comments and strings, is still colored with `font-lock'.

The entire buffer is colored initially.  Changes to the buffer
trigger recoloring.

Define your own colors by customizing faces like
`context-coloring-level-N-face', where N is a number starting
from 0.  If no face is found on a custom theme nor the `user'
theme, the defaults are used.

New language / major mode support can be added with
`context-coloring-define-dispatch', which see.

(autoload 'company-mode "company" "\
\"complete anything\"; is an in-buffer completion framework.

Completion starts automatically, depending on the values
`company-idle-delay' and `company-minimum-prefix-length'.

Completion can be controlled with the commands:
`company-complete-common', `company-complete-selection', `company-complete',
`company-select-next', `company-select-previous'.  If these commands are
called before `company-idle-delay', completion will also start.

Completions can be searched with `company-search-candidates' or
`company-filter-candidates'.  These can be used while completion is
inactive, as well.

The completion data is retrieved using `company-backends' and displayed
using `company-frontends'.  If you want to start a specific backend, call
it interactively or use `company-begin-backend'.

By default, the completions list is sorted alphabetically, unless the
backend chooses otherwise, or `company-transformers' changes it later.

\\{company-mode-map}
keymap during active completions (`company-active-map'):
